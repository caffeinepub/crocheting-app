  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-27 through REQ-30) are fully implemented in the diff. Console logging was added to Navigation.tsx for debugging identity and admin state. The useIsCallerAdmin hook now includes identity in the queryKey and has explicit logging. The Navigation component uses identity as a dependency and invalidates admin queries when identity changes. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
